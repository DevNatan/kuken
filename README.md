## Status
The current version of Katan is: **0.1.0**\
We are under constant development and a release will soon be released.\
<br>
Katan was initially created just as a joke so I can learn a little more about VueJS and Ktor.\
Docker was not previously supported, the servers were just *folders*.

## Docker
Support for Docker was recently added to Katan. All servers are now Docker containers.
The image used for container construction can be found here:\
